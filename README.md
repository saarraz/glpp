GL++ (glpp)
===========

OpenGL C++ Wrapper provides a C++ interface for the OpenGL API. The wrapper tries to expose all the logical objects of OpenGL standard to C++ native objects. This is not a graphics library, thus you will not find any assets manipulation or math functionality. However the library is designed to be easily coupled with an external math library like [glm](http://glm.g-truc.net/) or an assets manipulation library like [assimp](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/).
